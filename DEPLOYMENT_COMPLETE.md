gh run list --limit 5
gh run view [RUN_ID]
```

#### Server Management
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/roast-landing-key.pem ubuntu@107.21.59.129

### 📞 Support Information

#### Key Commands
```bash
# Deployment logs
gh run view --log

# Server logs
ssh ubuntu@107.21.59.129 'docker-compose -f /opt/roast-landing/docker-compose.prod.yml logs'

# Health check
curl https://tanta.com.ng/api/health

# SSL certificate status
